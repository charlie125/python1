Hi there, my name is Kuan-Yu, Yu. I'm currently a master student in University of Birmingham, majoring in Computer Science.
Well, this is my first python project which was inspired by Codedex, and I made this system on my own.
This is a library management system. it has a capabilities to add new book that you want.
It also can check which books status such as it's name, numbers and availability.

Hope those who watch my project can offer me suggestions on learning CS degree or python technique.

best regards
